# Hello!

### docker-website-template
This project uses docker compose to create 3 containers; apache-php, mysql and phpmyadmin. It's meant to spawn a development environment, but can probably be modded, to create something more production ready.

1. Clone the directory
2. Start with `docker-compose up --build`
